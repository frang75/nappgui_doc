h1.2D Boxes

p.2D containers or <i>(Bounding boxes)</i> delimit the area of the plane occupied by different geometric elements <r>bounding_box2d</r>. They are useful in the collision detection or <i>clipping operations</i>, which prevent non-visible figures from being drawn, improving overall performance.

img(bounding_box2d.svg,520,.65).Container with various geometric elements.
Drawing of a plan where a 2D container appears that integrates several figures.

func(B2D,null).Check if a container is null (without any geometry inside).
fret(bool_t).<c>TRUE</c> if is null, <c>FALSE</c> if contains any geometry.
fpar(const B2D*,box).The container.

func(B2D,add).Expand the dimensions of the box to contain the entry point. If the point is already within its area, the box is not modified.
fpar(B2D*,box).The container.
fpar(const V2D*,p).The point to include.

func(B2D,addn).Expand the dimensions of the box to contain several points. It is equivalent to calling the method <lf>b2d_addf</lf> successively.
fpar(B2D*,box).The container.
fpar(const V2D*,p).Vector points to include.
fpar(const uint32_t,n).Number of points.

func(B2D,merge).Expand the dimensions of <c>dest</c> to contain <c>src</c>.
fpar(B2D*,dest).The container that will be expanded.
fpar(const B2D*,src).The container that must be added.

func(B2D,overlap).Check if two boxes are overlapping.
fret(bool_t).<c>TRUE</c> if they are overlapping, <c>FALSE</c> if they are disjoint.
fpar(const B2D*,box1).First box.
fpar(const B2D*,box2).Second box.

const(B2D,NULL).Represents a null box (without geometry).

h1.Progress

p.Progress bars are passive controls that show the remaining time to complete a certain task <r>progress</r>. As time passes we must update the control. The undefined state will show an animation without indicating status, which will be useful when we cannot determine the required time. In <lh>Hello Slider and Progress!</lh> you have an example of use.

li.Use <lf>progress_create</lf> to create a progress bar.

li.Use <lf>progress_undefined</lf> to set the bar as undefined.

li.Use <lf>progress_value</lf> to update the progress of the task.

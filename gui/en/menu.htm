h1.Menu

p.A <b>Menu</b> is nothing more than a container (or window) that integrates a series of options, also called items or <b>MenuItems</b> <r>menubar</r>. Each one of them have a short text, optionally an icon and optionally also a keyboard shortcut, such as the classic <c>Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V</c> to copy and paste. Additionally, an item can house a submenu forming a hierarchy with different levels of depth. In <lp>products</lp> you have a sample application that uses menus.

p.The concept of the menu, like that of the window, exists from the origin of the graphic interfaces. The first computer to incorporate them was the Xerox Alto that appeared in 1973 and its commercial successor the Xerox Star. Concepts still very alive today such as: Menu, Window, Icon, Desk, or Mouse were already present on these computers that served as inspiration to Steve Jobs in the creation of Apple Lisa <r>apple_lisa</r>, predecessor of Machintosh and inspirer of Microsoft Windows.

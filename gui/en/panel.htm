h1.Panel

p.A <b>Panel</b> is a control within a window that groups other controls. It defines its own reference system, that is, if we move a panel all its descendants will move in unison since their locations will be relative to the origin of their predecessor. It will support other (sub)-panels as descendants, which allows to form a <b>Window Hierarchy</b> <r>window_hierarchy</r>. For portability, this <b>Gui</b> library does not support specific coordinates and sizes for elements linked to a panel, but the association is carried out by a <lt>Layout</lt> object which is responsible for calculating at runtime the final locations of controls based on the platform and window manager. In <lh>Hello Subpanel!</lh> you have an elementary example of using panels.

li.Use <lf>panel_create</lf> to create a new panel.

li.Use <lf>panel_layout</lf> to add child controls to the panel.

Scheme showing the hierarchy produced by panels, subpanels and controls.

p.Each panel supports several layouts and allows you to switch between them at runtime <r>multi_layout_panel</r>. This allows to create dynamic responsive interfaces with very little effort, since the panel itself is responsible for linking and sizing the controls according to the active layout in each case. In <lh>Hello Multi-layout!</lh> you have an example.

li.Use <lf>panel_visible_layout</lf> to change the layout.

Two different window settings using the same controls.

p.Because the layouts are logical structures outside the window hierarchy, they can share controls as they are linked to the same panel <r>multi_layout_asociation</r>. What is not allowed is to use the same objects in different panels, due to the hierarchy concept.

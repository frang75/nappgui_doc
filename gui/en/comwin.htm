h1.Common dialogs

p.Common dialogs are default windows provided by the operating system to perform daily tasks such as: Open files <r>file_explorer_windows</r>, select colors, fonts, etc. Its use is doubly beneficial. On the one hand we avoid programming them as part of the application and, on the other, we take advantage of the user's previous knowledge since they will surely have been used in other programs.

h1.View

p.Custom <b>View</b> are blank areas within the window that allow us to implement our own components. They are characterized by three things:

li.They are integrated within a <lt>Layout</lt> like the rest of interface elements. The layout will manage the position and size of the view based on its configuration.

li.They allow you to draw anything through the <b>OnDraw</b> event. The handler will receive a 2D context ready to draw.

li.They allow to capture the keyboard and mouse events produced by the user, which will make it possible to interact with the generated scenes.

li.They assume nothing about the content. It is the programmer who must synchronize the user's events with the drawing to produce the desired effect.

li.Use <lf>view_create</lf> to create a custom view.

li.Use <lf>view_OnDraw</lf> to draw in a view.

li.Use <lf>view_data</lf> to associate user data with the view.

p.We can't draw in the view whenever we want. Being an area within the window is subject to overlaps so the drawing buffer is managed by the operating system. The refresh cycle is divided into several steps <r>view_events</r>:

li.There is an event that requires updating the view content.

li.We call the <lf>view_update</lf> method to notify that the view must be updated. 

li.In a timely manner, the system will send an <c>OnDraw</c> event with an <lt>DCtx</lt> object ready to receive our drawing command. In <lp>drawimg</lp> or <lp>die</lp> you have examples of using custom views.

h1.View

p.The <b>View</b> controls or custom views <r>view</r> are blank areas within the window that allow us to implement our own components. We will have total freedom to draw and capture the mouse or keyboard events that allow us to interact with it. 

li.Use <lf>view_create</lf> to create a view.

li.Use <lf>view_data</lf> to set a data object.

li.Use <lf>view_get_data</lf> to get this object.

li.Use <lf>view_size</lf> to set the default size. See <lh>Natural sizing</lh>.

img(view.svg,520,.7).Custom view control.
Capture of a simple application that incorporates a custom view.

h2.Draw in views.

p.We cannot update the drawing area whenever we want. This can be affected by other windows in the environment, so the <i>framebuffer</i> is managed directly by the operating system. It will send a notification each time the control must refresh its content.

li.Use <lf>view_OnDraw</lf> to set the drawing handler.

li.Use <lf>view_update</lf> to force an area update.

p.In <lp>die</lp> you have a simple example application that implements drawing in custom views. The complete cycle can be summarized in these steps <r>view_events</r>:

li.Some event occurs that requires updating the content of the view.

li.The application calls the <lf>view_update</lf> method to notify that the view must be updated. 

li.At the appropriate moment, the system will send an <c>OnDraw</c> event with a <lt>DCtx</lt> context ready to draw.

img(view_events.svg,420,.6).Refresh cycle of a custom view.
Chart with the different phases of updating a view.

bq.The operating system can launch <c>OnDraw</c> events at any time without previously calling <c>view_update</c>.

h2.Scrolling views

p.It is possible that the "scene" to be rendered is much larger than the control itself, so it will show only a small fragment of it <r>bigdraw</r>. In these cases we will say that the view is a <i>viewport</i> of the scene. We can manage it in two ways:

img(bigdraw.svg,420,.6).Scene and view (viewport).
Relationship of a 2D scene to the viewport where it is displayed.

li.Use <lf>draw_matrix</lf> to indicate the transformation that integrates the movement, zoom and possible rotation of the viewport with respect to the scene. All this must be managed by the application and we do not have to do anything special, except call <c>view_update()</c> when necessary.

li.Use scroll bars that allow the user to move freely through the content. In this case, managing the view is a bit more complicated. This is what we must take into account:

lili.Include the constants <lt>ekVSCROLL</lt> and <lt>ekHSCROLL</lt> in the constructor.

lili.Use <lf>view_content_size</lf> to indicate the measurements of the scene, so that the bars are sized correctly.

lili.Use <lf>view_scroll_to</lf> to move the origin of the visible area.

lili.Use <lf>view_viewport</lf> to get the position and dimensions of the visible area.

p.Something very important is to avoid drawing non-visible elements, especially in very large scenes or with a multitude of objects. The operating system will send successive <c>OnDraw()</c> events as the user manipulates the scrollbars, indicating in the <lt>EvDraw</lt> structure the parameters of the visible area. In <lp>drawbig</lp> you have an example of how to correctly handle this type of case. 

bq.The dimensions of the viewport received in <c>OnDraw()</c> may be slightly larger than the actual measurements returned by <c>view_viewport()</c>. This is due to the fact that certain systems (macOS, Linux) force drawing in external non-visible areas near the edges, in order to avoid flickering in very fast movements.

h2.Using the mouse

p.In order to interact with the control, it is necessary to define handlers for the different mouse events <r>mouse_events</r>. The operating system will notify the user's actions so that the application can launch the relevant actions. It is not necessary to use all of them, only the essential ones in each case.

img(mouse_events.svg,360,.5).View position events.
Illustration of mouse events in a 2d view.

li.Use <lf>view_OnEnter</lf> to know when the cursor enters the view.

li.Use <lf>view_OnExit</lf> to know when the cursor leaves the view.

li.Use <lf>view_OnMove</lf> to know when the cursor is moving through the view.

li.Use <lf>view_OnDown</lf> to know when a button is pressed within the view.

li.Use <lf>view_OnUp</lf> to know when a button is released inside the view.

li.Use <lf>view_OnClick</lf> to identify a click (Fast Up + Down).

li.Use <lf>view_OnDrag</lf> to move the cursor with a pressed button.

li.Use <lf>view_OnWheel</lf> to use the mouse wheel.

bq.If the view uses scroll bars, the cursor (x,y) position passed to <lt>EvMouse</lt> in each event, refers to the global coordinates of the scene, taking into account the displacement. In views without scroll bars, they are the control local coordinates.

h2.Using the keyboard

p.In order to receive keyboard events, it is necessary that the view be able to obtain the focus, something that by default is disabled. 

li.Use <lf>layout_tabstop</lf> to include the view in the <i>tab-list</i> of the window and allow it to receive keyboard focus using the <c>[TAB]</c> key or by clicking on it.

li.Use <lf>view_OnKeyDown</lf> to know when a key is pressed (if the view has focus).

li.Use <lf>view_OnKeyUp</lf> to know when a key is released.

li.Use <lf>view_OnFocus</lf> to notify the application whenever the view receives (or loses) keyboard focus. In <r>view_focus</r>, the view changes the color of the active cell when it has focus.

img(view_focus.svg,460,.6).View without keyboard focus (left) and with it (right).
Changing keyboard focus between two controls.

p.In the <c>KeyDown</c> and <c>KeyUp</c> events a <lt>vkey_t</lt> will be received with the value of the pressed key. In <r>keycodes</r> and <r>extkeycodes</r> the correspondence of these codes is shown.

img(keycodes.svg,0,1).Keyboard codes.
Representation of a keyboard with the code of each key.

img(extkeycodes.svg,0,1).Keyboard Extended Codes.
Representation of an extended keyboard with the code of each extended key.

p.In <lh>Synchronous applications</lh> we may need to know if a key is pressed or not during the update cycle (synchronous) where we do not have access to the <c>OnKeyDown</c> and <c>OnKeyUp</c> events (asynchronous). This can be done by assigning the view a keyboard buffer using <lf>view_keybuf</lf>, which will capture the events associated with each key and allow us to consult its status at any time in a comfortable way.

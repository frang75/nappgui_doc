h1.Osbs

ep.There is no neat distinction between operating system software and the software that runs on top of it.
<i>Jim Allchin</i>

p.<b>osbs</b> <i>(Operating System Basic Services)</i> is a portable wrapper that allows applications to communicate with the operating system core at the level of processes, memory, files, networks, clocks, etc. This communication is carried out through a series of <b>system calls</b> <r>system_calls</r> which vary according to the operating system for which we are programming. It is the non-graphic lowest level API to communicate with hardware devices and access the machine resources. Below are the device drivers managed directly by the kernel, to which applications have access denied.

p.Darwin, the macOS kernel, and Linux are Unix-like systems, therefore, they share the same system calls (with subtle differences). But Windows presents a radically different architecture and function set. The NAppGUI <b>osbs</b> library is nothing more than a small wrapper that internally handles these differences and provides a common way to access the same resources on different platforms <r>osbs_depends</r>. It only depends on <lp>sewer</lp> and its functionalities have been divided into different modules:

li.<lp>bproc</lp>, <lp>bthread</lp>, <lp>bmutex</lp>.
li.<lp>bmem</lp>.
li.<lp>bfile</lp>.
li.<lp>bsocket</lp>.
li.<lp>bstd</lp>.
li.<lp>btime</lp>.
li.<lp>bmath</lp>.
li.<lp>log</lp>.

h2.Standard C library

p.The C standard library <i>(cstdlib)</i> is not part of the C language, but implements functions of great utility for the developer that solve typical programming problems. Any C programmer has used it more or less and its study is usually linked to learning the language itself <r>cstd_book</r>.

img(cstd_book.png,420,.3).A complete reference to the C library is found in the P.J.Plauger book.
"The C Standard Library" book cover.

p.This library is located halfway between the application and system calls and provides a portable API for file access, dynamic memory, I/O, time, etc <r>clib_depends</r>. It also implements mathematical functions, conversion, search, string management, etc. In one way or another, NAppGUI integrates its functionality into <i>osbs</i>, so it's not necessary (or advisable) to use <i>cstdlib</i> directly in the application layer. The reasons that have motivated this design decision can be summarized in:

img(clib_depends.svg,320,.4).The functionality of the C library has been integrated in <i>osbs</i>, avoiding its direct use in applications.
Schema showing the osbs library in relation to the standard C library.

li.<b>Small differences:</b> Unix-like systems do not support the secure <i>cstdlib</i> versions implemented by Microsoft (<c>strcpy_s()</c> and others). The use of classical functions (without the suffix <c>_s</c>) is insecure and will trigger annoying <i>warnings</i> in Visual Studio.

li.<b>Security:</b> Related to the previous one, <i>osbs</i> avoids <i>buffer overflow</i> vulnerabilities in the processing of memory blocks and strings.

li.<b>Duplicity:</b> Much of the functionality of <i>cstdlib is</i> already implemented in <i>osbs</i> using direct system calls (files, dynamic memory, I/O, time, etc.)

li.<b>Completeness:</b> The <i>cstdlib</i> functions related to files (<c>fopen()</c> and others) do not include support for directory management. <lp>bfile</lp> presents a complete API based on system calls.

li.<b>Performance:</b> In certain cases, especially in mathematical functions and memory management, it may be interesting to change the implementation of <i>cstdlib</i> to an improved one. All applications will benefit from the change, without having to modify your code.

li.<b>Clarity:</b> The behavior of some <i>cstdlib</i> functions is not entirely clear and can lead to confusion. For example, <c>strtoul</c> has a very particular functioning that we must remember every time we use it.
code.
char *s1 = "-56";
char *s2 = "asCr";
char *s3 = "467Xd";
int v1, v2, v3;
v1 = strtoul(s1, NULL, 10); // v1 = 4294967240, errno = OK
v2 = strtoul(s2, NULL, 10); // v2 = 0, errno = OK
v3 = strtoul(s3, NULL, 10); // v3 = 467, errno = OK
code.

li.<b>Style:</b> The use of <i>osbs</i> functions does not break the aesthetics of an application written with NAppGUI.
code.
real32_t a1 = 1.43f;
real64_t a2 = .38;
real32_t c = (real32_t)cosf((float)a1);
real64_t t = (real64_t)tan((double)a2);
...
real32_t c = bmath_cosf(a1);
real64_t t = bmath_tand(a2);
code.

li.<b>Independence:</b> NAppGUI internally uses a very small subset of <i>cstdlib</i> functions. It is possible that in the future we will make our own implementations and completely disconnect the support of the standard library.

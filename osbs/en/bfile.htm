h1.Files and directories

ep.Access to the local file system of the computer.

p.The file system is the hierarchical structure composed of directories and files that allows to organize the persistent data of the computer <r>filesystem</r>. It is something that computer users are very familiar with, especially after the irruption of the graphic systems that introduced the desktop simile, folder and document. It starts in a directory called root (<c>/</c> in Unix or <c>C:\</c> in Windows) and, from here, they hang all the sub-directories and files forming a tree that grows in depth.

p.At the programming level, the file system is managed through system calls that allow you to create directories, browse their contents, open files, delete them, obtain attributes, etc. A process can read or write data to a file after opening an I/O channel (<lp>stream</lp>) which provides a flow of binary data from or to the process itself <r>filestream</r>.

h2.Filename and pathname

p.These two concepts are recurrent and widely used by API functions that manipulate files. When we navigate through the contents of a directory <lf>bfile_dir_get</lf>, we obtain a sequence of <i>filenames</i> that is the "flat" name of the element (file or subdirectory) without including its path within the file system (without characters <c>'/'</c> or <c>'\'</c>). On the other hand the <i>pathname</i> is a sequence of one or several <i>filenames</i> separated by <c>'/', '\'</c>, which indicates the way forward to locate a certain element. This path can be <b>absolute</b> when it starts with the root directory (<c>C:\Users\john\docs\images\party.png</c>) or <b>relative</b> (<c>docs\images\party.png</c>) when it indicates the partial route from the process current <i>working directory</i>. This working directory by default can be changed with <lf>bfile_dir_set_work</lf>.

h2.Home and AppData

p.These are two typical directories used by applications to store files relative to a particular user. On the one hand, <i>home</i> indicates the personal directory of the user currently registered in the system, typically <c>C:\Users\john</c> (Windows), <c>/home/john</c> (Linux) or <c>/Users/john</c> (macOS) and we can get it with <lf>bfile_dir_home</lf>. On the other hand <i>appdata</i> <lf>bfile_dir_data</lf> is a directory reserved for saving temporary or configuration data of applications. Typical locations can be <c>C:\Users\john\AppData\Roaming</c> (Windows), <c> /home/john/.config</c> (Linux) or <c>/User/john/Library</c> (macOS). The usual thing will be to create a sub-folder with the name of the application <c>/User/john/Library/TheApp</c>.

h1.Memory

ep.Generic manipulation of memory blocks and <b>heap</b> handling.

p.From the programmer point of view, access to memory is done through variables and manipulated through the language operators (+, -, *, =, ...) and always in the same way, regardless of how the variables were created or in what memory zone they are hosted. In the case of <i>arrays</i> or generic blocks, within <c>bmem.h</c> we have several functions to make copies, assignments or verifications. This module also defines functions for dynamic memory manipulation <i>(Heap)</i>.

h2.Stack Segment

p.The memory of a compiled and running C program is divided into several segments. One of them is the <i>stack</i>, a space of variable but limited size, where local variables and function calls <i>(call stack)</i> are stored. It grows and shrinks as the process enters and leaves areas or functions <r>stack</r>. It is automatically managed by the compiler as a LIFO <i>Last-in First-out structure</i>, so it goes unnoticed most of the time, since it does not require extra attention from the programmer. We are aware of its existence when receiving the <i>Stack Overflow</i> error, usually caused by infinite recursion or the reservation of very large C vectors <r>stackover</r>. The debugger allows us to inspect the state of the stack at execution time <lh>Debugging the program</lh>.

code.

p.While the use of the <i>stack</i> is ideal due to its high performance, security and ease of use, sometimes falls short. On the one hand, it is necessary to foresee in the design time the amount of memory needed and define it statically (eg. <c>struct Product pr[100];</c>), something very inflexible when it comes to building real applications. On the other hand, variables are destroyed when closing a scope or leaving a function, which prevents sharing data globally. 

h2.Heap Segment

p.The <i>heap</i> is a memory zone that the process can request on demand, through calls to the system. It is complementary to the <i>stack</i> and is characterized by:

li.It can be accessed globally, from any point of the program through a pointer.

li.The amount of available memory is practically unlimited.

li.It is less efficient than the <i>stack</i>.

li.Requires management. Operating systems provide functions for requesting dynamic memory blocks (<c>HeapAlloc()</c>, <c>sbrk()</c>), being the responsibility of the process (programmer) to release these blocks when they are no longer needed.

p.As allocations and de-allocations can be made in any order, internal fragmentation occurs as the program progresses <r>heap</r>. Here would come into play the so-called <b>memory manager</b>, which are algorithms that allow optimizing the use of the heap by compacting it and reusing the released blocks. The standard C library provides the familiar functions <c>malloc()/free()</c>, which implement a generic memory manager through system calls.

bq.NAppGUI implements its own dynamic memory manager/auditor <lp>heap</lp> very optimized to serve numerous requests of small size, which is what applications demand normally. <lf>bmem_malloc</lf>/<lf>bmem_free</lf> connect to the operating system through system calls and should not be used directly.

h1.Processes

ep.A process is a running program that is launched and controlled by the operating system.

p.From the programmer perspective, multi-processing is the possibility of launching and interacting with other processes (children) from the main process (parent). The operating system can execute the child process in another CPU core <i>(true multitasking)</i> or in the same as the parent <i>(context switch)</i>. This is a system decision in which the programmer can not influence and will depend on the processor type and its workload. The final effect will be that both processes (parent and child) run in parallel.

h2.Launching processes

p.<lf>bproc_exec</lf> will launch a process from our own C program in a similar way as the Terminal does <r>run_process</r>. In this case, the <lp>bstd</lp> <c>stdin</c>, <c>stdout</c> and <c>stderr</c> will be redirected to the <lt>Proc</lt> object through anonymous pipes. From here, we can use <lf>bproc_write</lf> to write on the son <c>stdin</c> channel and <lf>bproc_read</lf> to read from his <c>stdout</c>. The rules of reading/writing are those that govern the operating system <i>pipes</i> and that we can summarize in:

Schema of a parent process and a child process linked by the Proc object.

li.If the parent calls <c>bproc_read</c> and the child has not written anything (empty buffer), the parent will be blocked (wait) until there is information in the child's output channel.

li.If the child ends and parent is waiting to read, <c>bproc_read</c> will return <c>FALSE</c> and the parent will continue his execution.

li.If the parent calls <c>bproc_write</c> and the writing buffer is full, the parent will block (wait) until the child reads from his <c>stdin</c> and free space in the channel.

li.If the child ends and the father is blocked by writing, <c>bproc_write</c> will return <c>FALSE</c> and the parent will continue his execution.

li.Some commands or processes (eg <c>sort</c>) will not start until reading the entire <c>stdin</c> contents. In these cases, the parent process must use <lf>bproc_write_close</lf> to indicate to the child that the writing on his <c>stdin</c> has finished.

li.When the parent calls <lf>bproc_close</lf>, all the I/O channels will be closed and both processes will continue their execution independently. To finish the execution of the child process <i>(kill)</i> use <lf>bproc_cancel</lf>.

li.<lf>bproc_wait</lf> will stop the parent process until the child completes. To avoid overloading the child output buffer <c>stdout</c>, close the channel through <lf>bproc_read_close</lf>.

li.<lf>bproc_finish</lf> will check, in a non-blocking way, if the child has finished running.

h2.Multi-processing examples

p.Let's look at some practical examples of IPC <i>Inter-Process Communication</i> using the standard I/O channels in linked parent-child processes. In <r>exread</r> we will dump the child process <c>stdout</c> output in a file. In <r>exwrite</r> we will redirect both channels, we will write in <c>stdin</c> and we will read from <c>stdout</c> using disk files. Finally, we will implement an asynchronous protocol where the parent and child exchange requests and responses. In <r>asynchild</r> we show the code of the child process, in <r>asynparent</r> the parent process and in <r>asynresult</r> the result of the communication, written by the parent process.

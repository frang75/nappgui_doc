ep.The <b>sockets</b> establish a communication channel between two remote processes through the Internet.

p.We can define a <b>socket</b> as a communication channel between two processes that are running on different machines. They use as a base the family of TCP/IP protocols that govern Internet communication from the first prototypes of the big network back in 1969. For its part, the IP protocol <i>(Internet Protocol)</i> is responsible for sending small data packets between two remote computers through the network. As there are packets that can be lost or take different paths when crossing the Internet nodes, TCP <i>(Transmission Control Protocol)</i> will be in charge of sorting them sequentially and re-ordering those that have been lost. Another important aspect that TCP adds is the concept of a <b>port</b>, which allows the same machine to have multiple connections open at the same time. The conjunction of TCP/IP provides the process of a reliable bidirectional communication channel <i>(full-duplex)</i> with the remote computer with which it has just connected and is the basis of the client/server model <r>socket</r>.

p.In the program, working with <i>sockets</i> is very similar to working with files on disk. The implementation of TCP/IP is complicated and is part of the operating system. We will access it through very simplified system calls that will allow us to create connections <lf>bsocket_connect</lf>, write on the channel <lf>bsocket_write</lf> and read from it <lf>bsocket_read</lf>. Since a socket only allows sending and receiving raw bytes, the dialogue between the two ends is determined by the established protocol, which both extremes must implement so that the communication occurs satisfactorily. Some of the most used on the Internet are: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, SSH, etc..

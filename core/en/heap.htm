ep.Optimized memory manager and <i>leaks</i> control.

p.<b>Heap</b> is a very efficient dynamic memory manager and auditor included in the <i>core</i> library and available for all programs based on NAppGUI (command line and desktop). It is common for applications to request a large number of small memory blocks to hold different objects (character strings, interface controls, structure instances, I/O buffer, etc). The strategy behind <i>heap</i> is just to ask the operating system for memory pages of a certain size (64kb) using <lf>bmem_malloc</lf> and use them to solve several requests. With this we pursue several objectives:

li.Performance: A call to <lf>heap_malloc</lf> is solved only by increasing the value of a counter. <lf>heap_free</lf> it only updates the header of the affected page.

li.Locality: Two consecutive calls to <c>heap_malloc()</c> are located in contiguous physical memory positions. This reduces the number of cache failures because, according to the locality principle, there is a high probability that two objects that are created together will be used together.

li.Memory leaks: <i>heap</i> points reservations and releases by object type. If necessary, will notify the programmer through <lp>cassert</lp> or <lp>log</lp> that there are objects not released. The great advantage of this auditor over other tools is that it is always being executed as part of the program. This exploits the temporal coherence, because if after a program change <i>leaks</i> are detected where there was not before, it is very likely that we can limit and detect the error, since it will be something we have just worked on.

li.Statistics: We can obtain memory usage profiles (time/bytes). This can help us detect bottlenecks (especially at startup) or optimize page size.

h2.How Heap Works

p.When a program starts, <i>heap</i> creates a default memory page. The first bytes are reserved as a header, a small structure that controls the state of the page. Each request is assigned sequentially within the same page, increasing the value of a pointer <r>heap_malloc</r>. When the page runs out of space, a new one is created <lf>bmem_malloc</lf>, which is linked to the previous one and labeled as the new <b>default page</b> <r>heap_new_page</r>. Each call to <lf>heap_free</lf> update the header with the number of blocks/bytes released <r>heap_free</r>. These blocks <b>are not reused</b>, otherwise the logic of <i>heap</i> would be complicated by slowing it down. The address of the header is stored at the end of each block, so do not have to iterate to locate it. When all the blocks on the page have been released, the entire page is destroyed by <lf>bmem_free</lf> and the pointers between neighboring pages restored <r>heap_delete_page</r>.

p.<i>Heap</i> also counts the number of alloc/dealloc per object type using the parameter <c>name</c> of <lf>heap_malloc</lf>. At the end of the execution of the program, if the application lacks <i>memory leaks</i>, it will write in <lp>log</lp> a message like this:

code(text).
[12:58:08] [OK] Heap Memory Staticstics
[12:58:08] ============================
[12:58:08] Total a/dellocations: 1126, 1126
[12:58:08] Total bytes a/dellocated: 74611, 74611
[12:58:08] Max bytes allocated: 54939
[12:58:08] Effective reallocations: (0/34)
[12:58:08] Real allocations: 2 pages of 65536 bytes
[12:58:08] ============================
code.

p(noindent).But if after the execution, the application has memory to be released, the message will be different:

code(text).
[13:00:35] [FAIL] Heap Object Leaks!!!
[13:00:35] ===========================
[13:00:35] 'App' a/deallocations: 1, 0 (1 leaks)
[13:00:35] 'String' a/deallocations: 414, 410 (4 leaks)
[13:00:35] ===========================
[13:00:35] [FAIL] Heap Global Memory Leaks!!!
[13:00:35] ==================================
[13:00:35] Total a/dellocations: 1161, 1156 (5 leaks)
[13:00:35] Total bytes a/dellocated: 75704, 75596 (108 bytes)
[13:00:35] Max bytes allocated: 54939
[13:00:35] ==================================
code.

p(noindent).That warns that we have an object <c>App</c> and four <c>String</c> without releasing. If in the previous execution there were no <i>leaks</i>, it is very likely that we can narrow the error without too much difficulty.

bq.The <i>heap</i> auditor does not intend to replace more advanced memory testing tools, it is only a first filter that constantly alerts us during the development and test phase. Although the overhead that occurs at runtime is minimal, the auditor is completely disabled in the <c>Release</c> configuration.

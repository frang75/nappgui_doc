h1.C/C++ JSON Web services

ep.JSON format is the most used for the exchange of data on the Web. Let's see how to call a Web service from a C/C++ application and "translate" your JSON response to the objects that form the data model.

p.<b>JSON</b> <i>JavaScript Object Notation</i>, is a data format in text mode that allows to easily represent basic types, objects and arrays. Although its use has become popular in the Web environment, it can also be used for other purposes, such as configuration files or local exchange. Its syntax is easy to understand for humans and simple to process for machines. In <r>jsonexample</r> we reproduce a small fragment of the JSON response of an <l>http://serv.nappgui.com/dproducts.php''example Web Service</l>:

code(text,jsonexample).JSON fragment returned by a Web Service.
{
    "code":0,
    "size":80,
    "data":[
    {"id":0,
    "code":"i7-8700K",
    "description":"Intel BX80684I78700K 8th Gen Core i7-8700K Processor",
    type":0,
    "price":374.8899999999999863575794734060764312744140625,
    "image":"cpu_00.jpg",
    "image64":"\/9j\/4AAQSkZJRgABAQ....
    },
    ...
}
code.

p.In its structure we can find these data types:

li.<b>Booleans:</b> Represented by constants <c>true</c> or <c>false</c>.

li.<b>Numbers:</b> Use the exponential notation of C for floating-point values: <c>2.3</c>, <c>.76</c>, <c>-0.54</c> or <c>5.6e12</c> they are valid examples of numerical values. JSON does not distinguish between integers, negatives or reals.

li.<b>Strings:</b> Any text in quotes is considered a string. Supports any Unicode character in <lh>UTF-8</lh> or through the escape sequence <c >\uXXXX</c >to indicate the codepoint.

li.<b>Objects:</b> They are delimited by keys <c>{...}</c> and composed of several fields separated by commas. Each field is formed by an identifier (string) followed by a colon and a value that can be any simple type, object or array <r>jsonobj</r>.

code(text,jsonobj).JSON object
{
    "field1" : true,
    "field2" : 24.67,
    "field3" : "Hello Pibe",
    "field4" : [1, 2, 4, 8.4],
    "field5" : { "x" : 34.32, "y" : -6.19 }
}
code.

li.<b>Arrays:</b> Lists of items delimited by brackets <c>[...]</c> and separated by commas. The values do not have to be the same type as usually happens in some programming languages <r>jsonarray</r>.

code(text,jsonarray).JSON array
[
    18, "Hello Pibe", true, { "x" : 34.32, "y" : -6.19 }
]
code.

li.<b>null:</b> Indicates the absence of value.

li.<b>Binaries:</b> JSON does not support binary data so opaque objects (images, for example) must be encoded in text and transmitted as a string type value. The most widespread and globally supported format is the <lp>base64</lp> where each character represents 6 bits of information.

h2.Call a web service

p.The first thing we should do is connect to the Web service through <lp>httpreq</lp> to perform the query and get the response JSON. We have two ways of doing it. The most direct is to use the method <lf>http_dget</lf> <r>httpget</r>.

code(cpp,httpget).Get a web resource using HTTP.
Stream *stm = http_dget("serv.nappgui.com", 80, "/dproducts.php", NULL);
code.

p.This call is very simple and useful to obtain resources directly, where it is not necessary to indicate parameters or configure the request. For other types of requests, we must create an object <lt>Http</lt> <r>httpconf</r>.

code(cpp,httpconf).Call to a web service with parameters
Http *http = http_create("serv.nappgui.com", 80, NULL);
if (http != NULL)
{
    Stream *stm = stm_memory(4096);
    http_param(http, "user", "brian");
    http_param(http, "pass", "1234");
    if (http_get(http, "/duser.php", stm, NULL) == TRUE)
    {
        ...
    }

    http_destroy(&http);
}
code.

p.If all went well, we will have in <c>Stream *stm</c> the server response in both cases. The next step will be "parsing it" to convert the sequence of characters that form the JSON to binary objects for use from the application <r>jsonread</r>. In <lh>JSON reading</lh> it is detailed how to link the JSON fields through the <b>DBind</b> register.

code(cpp,jsonread).Translate a JSON to a C object.
PJson *json = json_read(stm, NULL, PJson);
code.

p.<b>Briks</b> is a very simplistic imitation of the <b>Atari Breakout</b> video game, which will allow us to make an introduction to the world of <lh>Synchronous applications</lh>. Any real-time application must be constantly updating whether or not the user intervenes. The <b>source code</b> is in folder <c>/src/demo/bricks</c> of the SDK distribution.

li.Use <lf>osmain_sync</lf> to start a synchronous application, indicating an interval and update <i>callback</i> function. NAppGUI will periodically launch time events that will update the program.

Game capture bricks, imitation of the Atari Breakout.

p.This application is managed by two events <r>sync_event</r>. On the one hand the slider movement, which can occur at any time (asynchronous event), and will update the player position. On the other a synchronous event produced by <c>osmain_sync</c> every 40 milliseconds and will be notified through <c>i_update()</c> to update the game state and graphic view.

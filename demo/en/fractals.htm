p.In this application we create an procedural image by calculating the color of each pixel using fractal algorithms <r>fractals_win</r>. Some of the most fascinating results produced by a dynamic system occur when we iterate a complex variable function instead of a real one. This is the case of <b>Julia's sets</b>. The <b>source code</b> is in folder <c>/src/demo/fractals</c> of the SDK distribution.

p.Due to the large computational load of this algorithm we have divided the calculation into several threads <r>fractal_threads</r>. This problem is easily parallelizable simply by fractioning the image, because each pixel is obtained independently. In <r>threads</r> you have the execution times according to platform.
